Computer vision is the practice of writing algorithms which can discover patterns in visual data. 

In this work **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNN) will classify the images from Kaggle dataset [Diabetic Retinopathy Arranged](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanneo/diabetic-retinopathy-resized-arranged?select=0)  

The original datset came with images divided in 5 folder (0,1,2,3,4), each of them represents specific class labels.

* 0 - No DR - **No Diabetic Retina**: there are 25810 images.
* 1 - Mild - **Diabetic Retina Mild**: there are 2443 images .
* 2 - Moderate - **Diabetic Retina Moderate** : there are 5292 images
* 3 - Severe - **Diabetic Retina Severe** : there are 873 images
* 4 - Proliferative DR - **Diabetic Retina Proliferative** : there are 708 images

This 2 Notebooks provides a complete set of code to train and **predict** sane retina from diabetic retina  using   
the Tensorflow API applied on CNN.
